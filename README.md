# Library ðŸ“š

This branch uses ES6 class syntax instead of functions and prototypes.

Add a book to your library. You can add a new book to the library via the 'New Book' button. The library will store the book's title, author, pages and whether the book is read or not. 
It is possible to remove a book again. And to toggle the book as read/unread, after it was added.
